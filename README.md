# SDCOE Data Hub

The Data Hub prototype is a multifaceted yet easy-to-use interface between participating
organizations (e.g. LEAs) and a collaborative host that manages Ed-Fi ODS's for members.
The portal brings together automated Ed-Fi systems status with an ODS management request
capability, access to registered applications, dashboards and services and participant
contact information.   

When a member organization logs in, the Data Hub displays any active alerts and provides
a set of functional interactive "widgets": Ed-Fi status updates, Ed-Fi setup/maintenance
requests, services & products selector and list of links to subscribed services
(dashboards, 3rd party applications, etc.).  The system has integrated email notifications
for interactive features.  Additional demonstration widgets include: a support-ticketing
system, an ODS extract status list, and CRM-based contact list. 

Developed by the [San Diego County Office of Education](https://www.sdcoe.net), with support 
from the [Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation](https://www.dell.org).
